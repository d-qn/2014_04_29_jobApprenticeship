## plan

#### Context 
* Youth unemployement recently sky-rocketed in Europe (over 50% in Spain, 29% in Portugal,...)
  * Time series unemployement chart 

* The usual adage is that the more educated, the least likely to be unemployed: show 3 values. High / tertiary education has been strongly pushed by governements over the last X years. Especially in Europe (Bologna) and in developed countries
  * time series % tertiary education 
  
#### Conflict

* Interestingly, we observe however no clear correlation between youth higher education prevalence and youth unemployement
  * scatterplot of tiertary education levels and overall NEET 
  * scatterplot of upper secondary education levels and overall NEET 
  * --> Obviously youth unemployement depends on economic growth, however youth unemployment the sole result of the euro crisis (And the persistence of youth unemployment in many EU countries – Spanish youth unemployment, for example, was worryingly high even during the good years – implies that growth alone will not fix the problem)

### Youth unemployement - the swiss solution



* Youth's risk of being unemployed is 3x higher than that of an adult (1). In many european countries, youth unemployement recently sky-rocketed (over 50% in Spain, 29% in Portugal, ...) (2).

    * INFOGRAPHICS: line chart youth unemployement rate for some european countries including Switzerland, Germany, Austria
    

* Although it is widely accepted that salaries and unemployement rates are inversely correlated with the education level, Switzerland has paradoxically one of the lowest rate of higher education among developped  countries, while having the lowest youth unemployement rate in Europe (7.6%, not far in front of Germany and Austria)

    * INFOGRAPHICS - something such as: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR/countries/EU-CH-DE-US-ES-PT?display=graph
    
* One explanation for this conundrum is the prevalence of vocational training / apprenticeship in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. 
	* Explanation of apprenticeship

* Swiss (Austrian, German) model, why it works 
	* involves directly the companies/employers
	* valued certification
	
* INFOGRAPHICS: 
	* scatter plot showing the inverse correlation between the apprenticeship and unemployement rates by country _(not sure this is true and that data are available...)_ OR scatter plot showing the positive correlation between tertiary education and unemployement rate by country
	
	* Statistics aside, it is striking to observe that the 3 european countries with the lowest youth unemployement are the 3 countries where  vocational training is the most common and well-established. 

* EU measures to tackle youth unemployement (subsides, vocational training,...)
	
* The costs of youth unemployement
